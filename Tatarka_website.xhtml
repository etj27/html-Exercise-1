            I was born in <i>Foosha Village</i> in East Blue.  When I was seven I befriended a pirate crew lead by the man "Red-Haired" Shanks.  Having lived a life of relative lonliness I became attached to this crew of pirates as they set harbor within the village for a while.  I had always wanted them to take me with them on their adventures but I was never allowed to go since I was so young.  Shanks would often tease me about this.  After an incident with a local mountain bandit named Higuma, I had actually eaten a Devil Fruit, called the Gomu Gomu no Mi, that Shanks had owned and brought into a bar where he was partying.  From that moment on I had become a Rubber man and had lost the ability to swim in the sea as I was cursed by the Devil.

            Higuma had come into the bar and caused a mess because Shanks' crew had drank all of the alcohol.  This greatly upset me at the time because I had expected Shanks and his crew to fight back, but he only replied with, "It's just a little alcohol spilling, what's the big deal?  It's nothing to get mad at."  Having not understood the true meaning behind those words I had set off in search of Higuma to tell him to apologize to Shanks and his crew.  Being a little kid I was easily thrown aside by the large bandit and his group of ruffians and they had decided that due to me disrepecting them I was to be killed.  The village mayor tried to beg for my life with the Bar maid Makino but it was no use.  As I was close to being shot Shanks and his crew came to my rescue, showing me the true meaning of being a pirate.  It didn't matter whether or not you fought over silly events in a bar, but what truly mattered was valueing friendship and protecting each other.

            In a last ditch effort to escape, Higuma had grabbed me and make a run towards the sea in a small boat.  Having no more use for me he tossed me into the sea, trying to use all the strength to keep my head above water.  Karma is quite ironic, for as soon as Higuma tossed me out to sea his boat was attacked by a huge Sea King )a giant sea serpent) and he was killed.  Having finished off Higuma, the Seas King choose me as it's next target.  Before it's giant maw could swallow me whole, Shanks had swam up and pushed me me to safety. Shanks scared the Sea King off with the sheer intensity of his angry gaze.  Having been saved in a life or death situation I had started to get emotional but the next thing my eyes saw caused me to sob heavily.  At the cost of saving my life, Shanks had lost his arm to the Sea King.  Shanks didn't care and told me he was happy I was alive.  The very next day, Shanks and his crew were getting ready to leave and go back to their home, the sea.  For the first time I hadn't begged to be taken along with them and declared that I had aspirations to become a pirate as well but with a crew better than Shanks and my newly found dream of becoming the King of Pirates.  As a parting momento and the source of a promise between us, Shanks gave me his Straw Hat that he had always worn.  He had told me to give it back to him one day when I had become a great pirate.  This was the beginning of my tale.
